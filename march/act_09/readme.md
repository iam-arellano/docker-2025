To create a package.json file for your Node.js project, follow these steps:

1. Run the Following Command

In your project directory, open a terminal and run:
	npm init -y

This will generate a package.json file with default values.

2. 2. Install Required Dependencies

Since your project uses Express, Mongoose, and CORS, install them with:
	npm install express mongoose cors

For development, you might also want nodemon to restart the server automatically on file changes:
	npm install --save-dev nodemon
